# **_PRINTF**

This is an educational project to understand how printf works and the use of concepts like structures, function, pointers and more.

According to the kind of format, the function will convert this argument into the output expected by the user.

This project will give you hints of its use and how it works internally in the terminal and machine. 

The function will give the outputs of printing an integer, printing a character, printing a string or an array of any data proposed by the user. For understanding this process is necessary to read every file and contextualize every function to its implementation into the function _printf_.
